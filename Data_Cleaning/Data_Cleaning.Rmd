# Data Description and Cleaning Protocol

## Dataset Overview

This document describes the two primary datasets used in our analysis: the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) and the PLACES census tract health data, along with their respective cleaning procedures.

## 1. Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS)

### Background
The **Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS)** is administered by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) to a nationally representative sample of housing units. The survey collects comprehensive data on:

- Housing unit energy characteristics
- Household energy usage patterns  
- Demographic and socioeconomic information

For the 2020 survey cycle, the EIA transitioned from in-person interviews to web and mail-based data collection methods. Self-reported survey data are combined with actual energy consumption data from utility providers to estimate energy costs and usage patterns for various end uses including heating, cooling, and appliances.

### Energy Insecurity Measurement

In RECS 2020, household energy insecurity is operationalized through multiple indicators:

- **Financial strain**: Choosing between paying for essential needs (food/medicine) and energy bills
- **Temperature maintenance**: Inability to maintain home at safe or healthy temperatures
- **Service disruptions**: Receiving disconnection notices or experiencing service interruptions
- **Equipment limitations**: Being unable to use heating or cooling equipment due to:
  - Equipment breakdown with financial constraints for repairs
  - Utility service disruption due to non-payment
  - Inability to afford bulk fuel delivery
- **Extended outages**: Experiencing power outages lasting ≥24 hours

### Data Processing

#### Variable Selection
We selected the following variables to construct our energy insecurity measurement:

**Core Energy Insecurity Indicators:**

- `SCALEB`, `SCALEG`, `SCALEE` - Energy affordability scales
- `PAYHELP` - Difficulty paying energy bills
- `NOHEATBROKE`, `NOACBROKE` - Unable to use broken heating/cooling equipment
- `NOHEATEL`, `NOHEATNG`, `NOHEATBULK` - Heating fuel disruptions
- `NOHEATDAYS`, `NOACDAYS` - Days without heating/cooling
- `NOHEATHELP`, `NOACHELP` - Unable to get help with heating/cooling problems
- `COLDMA`, `HOTMA` - Maintaining unsafe temperatures
- `ENERGYASST` series - Receiving energy assistance programs

**Identification Variables:**

- `DOEID` - Unique household identifier
- `state_name` - Geographic location
- `nweight` - final sample weight

#### Final Measure

- `EI_number`,`EI_proportion`  - Number (million) and percentage of housing units. Household energy insecurity as defined in this table includes only those issues collected as part of the RECS questionnaire. These issues are forgoing paying for food or medicine in order to pay an energy bill, keeping the home at an unsafe or unhealthy temperature, receiving a disconnection notice, and being unable to use heating or air conditioning equipment because the equipment was broken and the household could not afford to fix it, the electricity or natural gas supply was disrupted due to nonpayment, or the household could not afford a bulk fuel delivery. 
- `PO_number`, `PO_proportion` - Number (million) and percentage of housing units. Household experienced a power outage lasting 24 hours or more.

#### Missing Data Imputation
We employed **hot-deck imputation** to address missing values:

1. **Matching Process**: Recipient households with missing values were matched to similar donor households with complete data
2. **Range-based Imputation**: Square-footage range responses informed donor selection when available
3. **Constraint Maintenance**: Imputed values were constrained within reported ranges to preserve data integrity

This approach maintains distributional properties while respecting the relationship between range responses and precise measurements.

## 2. PLACES: Census Tract Health Data

### Dataset Description
The PLACES dataset provides model-based census tract level estimates for the 2022 release in GIS-friendly format. Key features:

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All 50 states and District of Columbia
- **Multiple Geographic Levels**: County, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Areas
- **Uniform Methodology**: Consistent estimation approach across all geographic levels
- **CDC Partnership**: Developed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health

### Data Sources and Methodology
The model-based estimates integrate:

- **Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)**: 2020 data for 25 measures, 2019 data for 4 biennial measures
- **Census Bureau Data**: 2010 population estimates
- **American Community Survey**: 2015–2019 estimates

Funding support was provided by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation.

### Data Processing

#### Variable Selection Strategy
We focused on crude prevalence estimates while excluding confidence intervals to simplify analysis and visualization.

#### Data Cleaning Protocol
Our analysis revealed minimal missing data:

- **Overall Missingness**: 2,235 out of 72,337 records (3.09%)
- **Pattern Analysis**: Majority of missing cases (1,999 out of 2,235, 89.44%) lacked blood pressure and cholesterol measurements
- **Decision Rationale**: Given the importance of cardiovascular measures for health analysis and the concentrated nature of missingness, we implemented complete-case analysis by removing all records with missing values

### PLACES Dataset Variable Description

#### Geographic Identifiers

- **`tract_fips`**: Census tract FIPS code
- **`state_desc`**: State name  
- **`county_name`**: County name
- **`county_fips`**: County FIPS code
