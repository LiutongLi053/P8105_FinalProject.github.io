## The tentative project title : An Analysis of the association Energy Insecurity and General Health Status in the United States

## Motivation

General health represents a foundational dimension of public health, shaping both individual well-being and broader population stability. While traditional determinants such as income, employment status, and social isolation have been extensively studied, this research investigates a novel perspective by examining how energy insecurity influences overall health outcomes. Limited access to affordable, reliable energy—manifested through high utility costs or the inability to maintain adequate heating and cooling—can compromise daily functioning, increase physical and psychological stress, disrupt sleep patterns, and contribute to declines in overall health status. Using 2020 data from the EIA Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) and CDC PLACES, this study examines how household energy insecurity relates to population-level general health outcomes across U.S. state

## Intended Final Products

This project will deliver two primary outputs:

A comprehensive research report documenting the methodology, analysis, and findings

An interactive state-level dashboard visualizing the relationship between energy insecurity and general health outcomes

These deliverable will highlight regional disparities and identify geographic areas most affected by concurrent energy and general health challenges, providing valuable insights for policymakers and public health professionals.

## Anticipated Data Sources

This study utilizes two primary datasets from 2020 to ensure temporal consistency:

CDC PLACES Census Tract Data: Provides community-level health estimates, including crude prevalence of poor general health (ghlth_crude_prev)

EIA Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS): Offers detailed household-level information on energy consumption, costs, and insecurity indicators

We will focus specifically on energy insecurity metrics, such as the inability to afford adequate heating or cooling. Integrating these datasets enables robust analysis of the association between household energy conditions and community general health outcomes within the same reference period.

## Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding Challenges

We will integrate the 2020 CDC PLACES and EIA RECS datasets by aggregating both sources to the state level. After cleaning and harmonizing geographic identifiers, we will compute summary statistics, generate correlation matrices, and conduct regression analyses to evaluate the association between household energy insecurity and overall general health. Visualization techniques will include choropleth maps to highlight geographic disparities, violin plots to compare distributions across levels of energy insecurity, scatter plots to assess quantitative relationships, and heatmaps to summarize correlation patterns. A key analytical challenge involves merging datasets originally collected at different units—household versus census tract—and ensuring accurate alignment when producing state-level measures.
