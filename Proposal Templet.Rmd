## The tentative project title : An Analysis of the association Energy Insecurity and Mental Distress in the United States

## Motivation

Mental health represents a critical component of public health, significantly influencing both individual well-being and broader social stability. While traditional determinants such as income, employment status, and social isolation have been extensively studied, this research investigates a novel perspective by examining how energy insecurity impacts mental health outcomes. Limited access to affordable, reliable energy—manifested through high utility costs or the inability to maintain adequate heating and cooling—can induce chronic stress, disrupt sleep patterns, and exacerbate anxiety. Using 2020 data from the EIA Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) and CDC PLACES, this study explores how household energy insecurity relates to population-level mental distress across U.S. states.

## Intended Final Products

This project will deliver two primary outputs:

A comprehensive research report documenting the methodology, analysis, and findings

An interactive state-level dashboard visualizing the relationship between energy insecurity and mental health outcomes

These deliverable will highlight regional disparities and identify geographic areas most affected by concurrent energy and mental health challenges, providing valuable insights for policymakers and public health professionals.

## Anticipated Data Sources

This study utilizes two primary datasets from 2020 to ensure temporal consistency:

CDC PLACES Census Tract Data: Provides community-level health estimates, including crude prevalence of poor mental health (MHLTH_CrudePrev)

EIA Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS): Offers detailed household-level information on energy consumption, costs, and insecurity indicators

We will focus specifically on energy insecurity metrics, such as the inability to afford adequate heating or cooling. Integrating these datasets enables robust analysis of the association between household energy conditions and community mental health outcomes within the same reference period.

## Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding Challenges

We will integrate 2020 CDC PLACES and EIA RECS data by aggregating both to the state level. After cleaning and aligning geographic identifiers, we will calculate summary statistics, correlation matrices, and perform regression analyses to evaluate the association between energy insecurity and mental distress. Visualizations will include choropleth maps to reveal geographic disparities, violin plots to compare distributions across insecurity types, scatter plots to assess quantitative relationships, and heatmaps to display correlation patterns. The main coding challenge involves merging datasets collected at different units—household versus census tract—and ensuring accurate state-level alignment.
